Now I'll ask you to do something.
There is a pearl at the bottom of the sea.
Dive in the depths and bring the pearl to the surface.
One thing... The souls of the people who hurt you in the past are in the ocean, too.
Protecting the pearl.
You don't have to kill them, but I think you might want to get your vengeance from them.
Bringing the pearl to the ocean without a murder is up to you.
Another thing...
You spend your health each time you attack someone.
Consider this before attacking any soul.
Good luck!
